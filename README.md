# Employee_Management_System

<strong> Name </strong>

The name of this app is <i>Employee_Management_System</i> as it is designed to manage employees of a company.

<strong>Description</strong>

As a web developer, I want a deployed portfolio that can showcase my work to potential employers and clients. It is in that spirit that my instructor gave me and other students this homework to design a node application that companies can use to manage employees.

<strong>Programs used</strong>

I used Javascript, jquery, node.js, mysql and of course Git/Github were used as version control.

<strong>Installation</strong>

This is a node js application and needs to be clone and run in your code editor (VC). it is currently hosted in github and you can access it at https://github.com/Janviermbilizi/Employee_Management_System.

<strong>Usage</strong>

This application is simple, clean, easy to use and undertand. After cloning, installing node and opening the folder in your code editor (VC), you need to run npm intall, then create database and tables by using db folder content (schema.sql) to start in your workbench. if you want to start with some data in the tables you can copy paste db/seed.sql content in the database you created. After that, go back to the application and run node app.js. You will be prompted with everything you need to create, view, update and delete content from/to you database. Don't forget to change your database connection information like user/username and password and port if not the default 3306. Make sure to keep the same database name and tables as provided in db folder.
